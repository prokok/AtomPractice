Opening a File in a Project

Ctrl + T or Ctrl + P : Fuzzy Finder will pop up. search for any file in your project opened in Atom by typing parts of the path.
Ctrl + B : search through only the files currently opened (rather than every file in your project) . This searches through your "buffers" or open files.
Ctrl + Shift + B : searches only through the files which are new or have been modified since your last Git commit.


The fuzzy finder uses the core.ignoredNames, fuzzy-finder.ignoredNames and core.excludeVCSIgnoredPaths configuration settings to filter out files and folders that will not be shown. If you have a project with tons of files you don't want it to search through, you can add patterns or paths to either of these config settings or your standard .gitignore files. We'll learn more about config settings in Global Configuration Settings, but for now you can easily set these in the Settings View under Core Settings.

Both core.ignoredNames and fuzzy-finder.ignoredNames are interpreted as glob patterns as implemented by the minimatch Node module.

-Configuration Setting Notation-

Sometimes you'll see us refer to configuration settings all spelled out like "Ignored Names in Core Settings". Other times you'll see us use the shorthand name like core.ignoredNames. Both of these refer to the same thing. The shorthand is the package name, then a dot ., followed by the "camel-cased" name of the setting.

If you have a phrase you want to camel-case, follow these steps:
1. Lowercase the first word
2. Capitalize the first letter in all other words
3. Remove the spaces
So "Ignored Names" becomes "ignoredNames".
